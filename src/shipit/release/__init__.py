"""release — the Release pipeline's cores and registries (TOL02).

A **Release** carries ONE repo-level version whose authority is the git tag;
manifests are projections of the tag decision (ADR-0041). This package holds
the pipeline's pure cores and closed registries, stage by stage as the TOL02
work streams land:

- :mod:`.version` — the version resolver (WS01): supplied ``<semver>`` or bump
  word → the resolved version, prerelease flag, and resume verdict. Pure.
- :mod:`.bump` — the per-toolchain bump-adapter registry and the
  artifact-declared bundle-config hook (WS01): how the tag decision projects
  into manifests. Command literals + pure text rewrites; no I/O.
- :mod:`.preflight` — the release-side planner (WS02): (artifact map,
  resolved version, event) → the machine-readable plan (OS×arch matrix, live
  stages, post-RC-guard endpoints, required secrets) the composed workflow
  consumes as job outputs. Pure.
- :mod:`.secretreq` — secrets derivation (WS02): registry entries declare
  the secret NAMES they require; traversing the repo's declarations yields
  the one required set gh-setup syncs, preflight validates, and the
  cross-org caller's ``secrets:`` block lists. Pure.
- :mod:`.bundle` — the closed bundle-composition registry (WS03): how a
  declared artifact composes build outputs into its unsigned distributable
  (archive, deb, wheel, mac-app). Command literals + compose functions,
  effectful only through the injected exec seam.
- :mod:`.integrity` — the assert-bundle pure core (WS03, workflows.lex
  §3.2): the expected-main-binary fallback chain and the bundle-tree check
  behind ``shipit release assert-bundle``.

The effectful shells live in :mod:`shipit.verbs` (``shipit release prepare`` /
``preflight`` / ``bundle`` / ``assert-bundle`` are :mod:`shipit.verbs.release`),
executing through the one Exec seam (ADR-0028) and the git adapter.

class ReleaseError(RuntimeError):
    """A release-stage domain refusal — exit 1 via the shared CLI error shell
    (:mod:`shipit.verbs._errors`), one ``error: …`` line, never a traceback.

    Raised for runtime refusals of the release stages: a no-op bump (the
    manifests already carry the target version but its tag does not exist —
    re-running against a different release), a manifest a bump adapter cannot
    rewrite, a prepare invoked outside a git checkout or on a detached HEAD,
    a bundle composition over missing build outputs (no built binary, no
    ``.deb``/wheel/sdist produced, no coupled ``.app``/``.dmg`` pair or
    reseal payload), and an assert-bundle whose expected name cannot be
    resolved (an unknown or unnamed artifact). USAGE errors (a malformed
    version argument) are NOT this class — they die at the click boundary as
    exit 2 (ADR-0030).
