"""The bundle composition registry — build outputs → unsigned Artifacts.

``shipit release bundle`` (TOL02-WS03, workflows.lex §1) is the stage that
composes toolchain outputs into the unsigned distributables ("package" is
retired as a word — the stage is bundle). This module is its CLOSED
composition registry — the lint ``Lang`` / toolchain-registry shape, one
entry per way an artifact composes (ADR-0007: the bundle step is DECLARED
per artifact via ``[artifacts.<name>].bundle = { composition = "…" }``,
keyed off the map — never a project-Kind switch) — plus the compose
functions the entries carry:

- **archive** — the legacy ``rust-cli.yml`` "Package binaries" contract: a
  ``<name>-<target>/`` staging subdir carrying the built binary plus docs
  (README/CHANGELOG/LICENSE when present), archived as
  ``<name>-<target>.tar.gz`` (``zip`` + ``.exe`` for windows targets) — the
  exact layout the brew formulas and GH release assets already assume.
- **deb** — cargo-deb against the PRE-BUILT release binary
  (``--no-build --no-strip``: the deb wraps the same binary the tarball
  ships — the legacy ``build-deb.yml`` contract), hard-failing when no
  ``.deb`` appears. cargo-deb is SELF-PROVISIONED (``cargo install
  cargo-deb --version <pin> --locked``, pinned for a reproducible build)
  when absent from PATH: it is not on conda-forge, so no pixi env can carry
  it, and the wf-build runner arrives without it (issue #784 F2). cargo-deb
  receives ``--target <triple>`` EXACTLY when the build was cross-compiled
  (``ComposeRequest.build_target`` set — TOL02-WS11): a native build writes
  ``target/release/`` and cargo-deb reads it with no ``--target``, a cross
  build writes ``target/<triple>/release/`` and cargo-deb is pointed there by
  the SAME triple (which also derives the Debian arch). The triple-dir
  contract's one owner is that threaded target — build, archive, and deb all
  read where the build actually wrote (issue #785 deferral, resolved by #787;
  :func:`shipit.tools.e2e.binary_location` shares the derivation). Linux
  targets only.
- **wheel** — ``uv build`` emitting BOTH the wheel and the sdist into the
  bundle output tree (the legacy ``python-pkg.yml`` build job: one build,
  consumed by multiple publish targets).
- **wasm-pack** — the wasm/npm leg (TOL02-WS12 #788, WS10 DECIDED #798:
  bespoke ``wasm-pack`` composition, pixi provisions ``wasm-pack`` + the
  wasm32 target, the npm tarball is the artifact). ``wasm-pack build`` the
  rust leg's crate into a fresh ``pkg/`` npm package tree (wasm + JS glue +
  ``package.json``, the version wasm-pack reads from the crate's ``Cargo.toml``
  — bumped by ``release prepare``), then ``npm pack --ignore-scripts`` that
  tree into the ONE ``<pkg>-<version>.tgz`` npm tarball staged under the bundle
  output tree (``--ignore-scripts`` forecloses a package lifecycle script —
  ``prepare``/``prepack``/``postpack`` — running arbitrary code as a SECOND
  build path during bundle, the same guarantee the npm publish leg makes on the
  prebuilt tarball, ``release/publish.py``).
  That tarball is BOTH the gh-release asset and exactly what the npm endpoint
  publishes (``release/publish.py`` — no rebuild), and the assert-bundle npm
  tier reads its inner ``package.json`` ``name`` as the assertable identity.
  The optional ``scope`` / ``wasm-target`` declarations are the only
  consumer-specific parts (``@scope`` and wasm-pack's ``--target``, default
  ``bundler``); every other flag is registry-assembled. The scratch ``pkg/``
  tree is always removed — only the tarball survives (ADR-0009's barrier: a
  composition writes only its declared artifact under ``out_dir``).
- **vsix** — a per-target VS Code extension ``.vsix`` via ``npm exec -- vsce
  package --target <vsce-target> --out <name>-<vsce-target>.vsix`` (the legacy
  ``vscode-ext.yml@v3`` per-platform packaging: one ``.vsix`` per platform,
  each carrying that platform's prebuilt native binary). The declared platform
  triple picks the vsce target string (:data:`VSCE_TARGETS`; darwin-arm64 /
  darwin-x64 / linux-x64 / linux-arm64 / alpine-x64 / win32-x64), a triple with
  no vsce target being a loud refusal. Runs ``vsce`` through ``npm exec`` in the
  ``npm`` leg (the extension is a node package) — vsce is the consumer's
  ``@vscode/vsce`` devDependency under ``node_modules/.bin``, never a
  fleet-provisioned PATH binary, so the local package context resolves it. A
  ``.vsix`` is a zip package with no reopenable main binary, so — like wheel,
  wasm-pack, and tarball — it is NOT binary-asserting (``asserts_binary=False``,
  the scar-#2 guard is skipped). The per-target binary it bundles is produced
  by the build stage — for ``win32-x64`` that binary comes from the
  cross-target build (TOL02-WS11 #787, the windows leg's stated dependency, not
  hidden), which writes ``target/<triple>/release/`` for the extension's
  prepackage step to stage.
- **mac-app** — the coupled UNSIGNED ``.app``/``.dmg`` pair (the declared
  bundler builds the .app inside the .dmg run; they are not cleanly
  separable) PLUS the inner ``.app`` re-emitted as the reseal payload
  (``<name>.unsigned-app.tar.gz``, a tar preserving symlinks and exec
  bits): cross-job artifact upload destroys a ``.app``'s symlinks and exec
  bits, and the signer reseals the ``.dmg`` from the SIGNED ``.app``
  (workflows.lex §3.1: bundle-unsigned → sign-reopens-and-reseals, never
  sign-then-bundle). The declared ``command`` is the only consumer-specific
  part; a missing payload is a bundle-stage failure, never a signer
  surprise. Mac targets only.
- **tauri** — the tauri app bundler as a DECLARED-command composition, the
  mac-app shape (TOL02-WS15 #791, WS10 DECIDED #798: bespoke composition,
  "same naked-.app/.dmg sign-path argument as electron"). ONE declared
  ``tauri build`` (the consumer's own — e.g. ``npm run tauri build`` against
  the consumer's ``@tauri-apps/cli``, the one consumer-specific part, exactly
  like mac-app/electron-builder's declared bundler) leaves the platform's
  bundles under the declared ``source`` dir, and the composition collects
  whatever that platform produces. Because the bundler is DECLARED (not a
  registry-assembled argv), the tauri CLI is CONSUMER-OWNED — the consumer's
  manifest provisions it, NOT a shipit-managed pixi block: a declared command
  is the consumer's to provision, so tauri never becomes a release Exec tool
  and takes no provisioning-guard row (only registry-ASSEMBLED builders like
  wasm-pack ride pixi provisioning — docs/dev/release-tool-provisioning.md).
  Collection is NON-DESTRUCTIVE (it never deletes under the consumer's
  declared ``source`` — a config typo must never cost a file) and reads only
  the tool-CONTROLLED per-format subdirs tauri writes, never a name-blind
  recursive sweep of ``source``:

  - on **darwin** — the coupled ``.app``/``.dmg`` pair PLUS the reseal payload,
    the EXACT mac-app shape (the shared :func:`_stage_mac_pair`): the mac
    signer is consumer-agnostic and keys off the ``*.unsigned-app.tar.gz``
    payload, not the composition (workflows.lex §3.1 — "the only tauri-specific
    part is the bundler"), so a tauri darwin bundle rides the same sign path as
    electron with zero signer changes;
  - on **linux** — each format's ONE primary output from its subdir of the
    bundle dir (:data:`_TAURI_LINUX_FORMATS`: ``appimage/*.AppImage``,
    ``deb/*.deb``), staged into the output tree.

  Windows is out of scope (the legacy ``tauri-app.yml`` ships no
  ``icon.ico``, #791), so the composition is gated to darwin+linux targets and
  a windows leg is a clean skip, never a surprise. A darwin bundle missing its
  pair, or a linux bundle producing no ``.AppImage``/``.deb``, is a hard
  bundle-stage failure, never a quiet pass (ADR-0009's barrier); so is a
  format subdir holding more than one primary bundle (a stale prior output —
  never a nondeterministic pick).
- **electron** — electron-builder's per-platform distributable set (the
  darwin ``.dmg`` + ``.dmg.blockmap`` sidecar, the linux ``.AppImage``, the
  windows ``.exe`` + ``.exe.blockmap``), collected from the declared
  ``source`` output tree after the declared bundler runs. LIKE mac-app,
  electron is SIGNABLE through the standalone macOS sign stage: the bundler's
  own signing stays OFF, the darwin ``.app`` ships UNSIGNED and is re-emitted
  as the ``<name>.unsigned-app.tar.gz`` reseal payload the signer reopens →
  resigns → reseals → notarizes (ADR-0040, TOL02-WS14 #790). So a ``sign =
  true`` electron artifact derives its Apple creds through the standard
  sign-stage path, no build-time secret. The one nuance vs mac-app: electron's
  darwin ``.app`` NESTS helper ``.app`` bundles, so the TOP-LEVEL ``.app`` is
  the one staged. The reseal payload carries it across the artifact boundary
  (upload strips a ``.app``'s symlinks/exec bits); assert-bundle reads its
  ``CFBundleExecutable`` as the darwin anchor. Linux/windows legs ship unsigned.
  Mac/linux/windows targets only (the windows leg's integrity + endpoint land
  with WS11).
- **tarball** — the generated-parser ``<name>.tar.gz`` (TOL02-WS16 #792,
  legacy ``tree-sitter.yml@v3``): the tree-sitter leg's generated ``src/``
  tree plus the grammar/queries/bindings that are present. Platform-
  independent (generated C source, no per-OS variant — no ``-<target>``
  suffix), so every matrix leg composes the identical bytes.

Every external command runs through the injected runner — the one Exec seam
(ADR-0028); the ``cargo`` / ``uv`` / ``wasm-pack`` / ``npm`` / ``tar`` /
``zip`` / ``vsce`` argv literals below are those tools' one BUNDLE-side
assembly point, whitelisted in the
mechanized argv sweep (``tests/test_tool_argv_sweep.py``). Compose functions
write ONLY under the request's bundle output tree (ADR-0009's barrier: a
failing composition exits with nothing half-written outside it); uploading
anything anywhere is publish's job, signing the signer's.

The effectful shell (walking the artifact map, deciding which compositions
apply to the current target) is ``shipit release bundle``
(:mod:`shipit.verbs.release`); the sibling integrity guard is
:mod:`shipit.release.integrity` (``assert-bundle``).

    The naked ``.app`` rides the bundle tree, but the reseal payload is what

    overwrites in place (vsce replaces, never appends). The native binary vsce
    bundles for this target is the build stage's output — for ``win32-x64`` the
    cross-target build's (TOL02-WS11 #787). A run that leaves no ``.vsix`` is a

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Composition:
    """One registry entry: a composition name, the compose function it runs,
    and the target platforms it applies to.

    ``platforms`` is a tuple of target-triple substrings; empty means every
    platform (archive, wheel). ``declared_command`` marks the compositions
    whose producing command is DECLARED on the artifact (mac-app's bundler)
    rather than registry-assembled — the config boundary validates the
    declaration shape against it (:func:`shipit.config._parse_bundle`).
    ``signable`` marks the compositions the mac signer can reopen
    (:mod:`shipit.release.sign` — the mac-app leg's reseal payload, the
    archive leg's tarball, TOL02-WS08 #779): the config boundary refuses
    ``sign = true`` on any other composition, so a sign declaration can
    never route to a signer leg that does not exist. ``asserts_binary`` marks
    the compositions whose output carries a MAIN BINARY the scar-#2 integrity
    guard checks (:mod:`shipit.release.integrity`, workflows.lex §3.2) —
    archive/deb/mac-app. A source/package composition (wheel's sdist+wheel,
    tarball's generated C, wasm-pack's npm tgz) has no binary to name, so the
    preflight planner omits the ``assert-bundle`` stage for it
    (:func:`shipit.release.preflight.plan`): running the guard over a source
    ``.tar.gz`` would hard-fail with "no main binary" (the deb tier's #784-F4
    lesson, inverted — nothing to assert).
    ``platform_independent`` marks the compositions whose output carries NO
    ``-<target>`` qualifier — the tarball's generated C source is identical on
    every OS, so it emits one unqualified ``<name>.tar.gz`` (parity with legacy
    ``tree-sitter.tar.gz``); the wasm-pack npm ``<name>-<version>.tgz`` is the
    sibling case (#828) — ``npm pack`` version-qualifies the filename but never
    target-qualifies it. Because ``wf-publish.yml``
    merges every leg's
    ``dist/`` into one flat tree (``merge-multiple``), a name without the
    ``-<target>`` qualifier
    built on more than one leg would COLLIDE (last writer wins, and tar bytes
    are not guaranteed identical across runners — mtimes/uid/gid), so the
    config boundary refuses such a composition declared with >1 ``platforms``
    (:func:`shipit.config._parse_artifact`): it must build on exactly one leg.
    ``option_keys`` are the
    EXTRA optional declaration keys a registry-assembled composition accepts
    (wasm-pack's ``scope`` / ``wasm-target`` — the ``@scope`` and wasm-pack
    ``--target``, the only consumer-specific parts); the config boundary
    accepts them ONLY for the composition that names them and rejects them
    everywhere else (:func:`shipit.config._parse_bundle`). ``provisions_signal``
    names a toolchain SIGNAL a declared composition needs beyond its own leg —
    wasm-pack's ``npm pack`` needs the node runtime (``npm`` rides ``nodejs``),
    but wasm-pack rides the RUST signal and a rust-only wasm crate's npm
    ``package.json`` is GENERATED into ``pkg/``, never tracked, so the node
    manifest signal is absent (issue #788 review). ``shipit install`` unions
    this signal into the detected toolchains off the declared composition
    (:func:`shipit.verbs.install._composition_signals`), delivering the
    node-deps block wherever the composition is declared; ``None`` (every
    composition but wasm-pack) adds nothing.
