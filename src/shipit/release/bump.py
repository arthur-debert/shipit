"""The bump-adapter registry — how the tag decision projects into manifests.

ADR-0041: the tag is the version authority; manifests are PROJECTIONS of the
tag decision. This module is the closed per-toolchain registry (the lint
``Lang`` set's mirror, one entry per :mod:`shipit.tools.registry` toolchain)
of those projections, plus the artifact-declared bundle-config hook:

- **rust** — ``cargo set-version --workspace`` (workspace-wide, intra-workspace
  deps included) then ``cargo update --workspace`` (lock refreshed) — the
  legacy ``prepare-release.yml`` bump, forked by copy (ADR-0001/0010).
  ``set-version`` is a cargo-edit subcommand, provisioned through the
  shipit-MANAGED pixi surface for rust consumers (the
  ``pixi.toml#shipit-rust-release-deps`` block, issue #793) — when it is
  absent, prepare fails LOUDLY naming the install reconcile
  (:func:`explain_command_failure`) and NEVER installs at run time (the #582
  cache doctrine: provisioning rides setup-pixi's lockfile-keyed cache).
- **npm** — ``npm version <v> --no-git-tag-version`` (``package.json`` +
  ``package-lock.json``; the git side stays prepare's, so the tag/commit
  never happens twice).
- **python** — a PURE rewrite of ``pyproject.toml`` ``[project].version``,
  deliberately toolchain-free (the legacy ``prepare-release-python`` choice).
- **go** — the first-class ZERO-FILE adapter (PRD story 22, ADR-0041): the
  tag is the source of truth, the version is injected at build via
  ``-ldflags -X`` (:mod:`shipit.tools.build`). Not an exception — an entry
  whose projection set is empty.

"tauri" is NEVER a registry key (PRD story 25, ADR-0007): a Tauri app is a
composition of the npm and rust legs, and its bundle-level version file
(``tauri.conf.json``) is bumped by the artifact-declared bundle-config hook —
``[artifacts.<name>] bundle-config = "src-tauri/tauri.conf.json"`` in
``.shipit.toml`` (:class:`shipit.config.Artifact`), applied by
:func:`bump_bundle_config` in lockstep with the leg adapters.

Everything here is pure data + pure text rewrites: the adapter COMMANDS run
in the effectful shell (``shipit release prepare``,
:mod:`shipit.verbs.release`) through the one Exec seam (ADR-0028) with cwd at
the leg's map path; the rewrites are string→string functions, fixture-tested.
The command literals below are these tools' one RELEASE-side assembly point,
whitelisted alongside :mod:`shipit.tools.registry` in the mechanized argv
sweep (``tests/test_tool_argv_sweep.py``).
