"""identity — shipit's canonical git-identity value objects + resolvers (ADR-0024).

The **deep module** for shipit's core nouns as identity value objects: **`Repo`**
(`owner`, `name`), **`Owner`** (`login`, `kind`) / **`OwnerKind`**, **`Sha`**
(a full commit object id), and
**`WorkingDir`** (`path`, `repo`, `revision`). Each is defined ONCE here so every
subsystem keys on the same thing — most load-bearingly the eval store, which keys
by :class:`Repo` identity so one repo's runs pool across every clone.

Two rules make this layer offline- and Tree-safe (ADR-0022):

- **Identity derives LOCALLY.** A :class:`Repo` is read from the origin remote
  (``git remote get-url origin``), never a live API call — so it resolves inside a
  dissociated Tree with no network. :func:`resolve_owner_kind` is the ONE resolver
  that touches the API, and it enriches an OPTIONAL field that is *not* part of
  identity.
- **`OwnerKind` is excluded from identity.** ``Owner.kind`` is ``compare=False``,
  so an :class:`Owner` — and the :class:`Repo` composing it — hashes and compares
  identically before and after the kind is enriched. The store key never moves
  when kind is resolved.

The value objects are thin, frozen, and composable (ADR-0021): a
:class:`WorkingDir` *has-a* :class:`Repo`, a :class:`Repo` *has-an* :class:`Owner`
— composition, never inheritance (a **Tree** *has* a WorkingDir; the **main
checkout** is a WorkingDir that is not a Tree). Logic lives in free functions over
them (``resolve_*``), each taking an injectable git ``boundary`` (defaulting to
:mod:`shipit.gh`) so the module is unit-testable in isolation with a fake boundary
and fixtures.

    SHA-256) and is **lowercase-normalized**, so a case-varying source can never

    returning ``False`` — the silent ``==`` between a short/case-varying string

    reads stale because ``"ABC..." != "abc..."``), so it is impossible by
    construction: a prefix cannot BE a ``Sha``, and a raw string refuses to
    compare. Prefix matching is the explicit :meth:`matches_prefix` ask.

    ``__hash__`` deliberately matches ``hash(self.value)``: a dict/set holding
    ``Sha`` keys probed with an equal raw string lands in the same bucket and
