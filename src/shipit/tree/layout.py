"""``tree/layout`` — pure resolution of a Tree request into a concrete plan.

``plan(spec) -> TreePlan`` is the deep, pure heart of Tree creation: given a
:class:`TreeSpec` it resolves the three coordinates a clone needs — the **dir**
on disk, the **branch** to check out, and the **base** ref to cut it from — with
no I/O, so the truth table is unit-tested directly (Testing Decisions in the PRD).

:func:`plan` resolves EVERY spec shape — ``--issue N [--slug S]``,
``--epic E --ws N [--slug S]``, and freeform ``--branch <name>`` (naming.lex §3).
:class:`TreeSpec` stays a single typed entry point: adding a shape is adding a field
plus a branch in :func:`plan`, not reshaping callers.

The three load-bearing invariants the tests pin (from the PRD):

- the **agent hash lands on the dir, never on the branch** — two sessions sharing
  one branch is fine, two Trees in one dir is not; the hash disambiguates the dir
  while the branch stays a stable, meaningful namespace;
- the **git branch form is slash-namespaced** (naming.lex §3): a work stream is
  ``EPIC/WSnn`` cut from ``origin/EPIC/umbrella``, siblings under ``refs/heads/EPIC/``
  — the umbrella name dodges the bare-``EPIC`` ref/dir collision. The plain-language
  identifier stays hyphenated (``EPIC-WSnn`` in titles/logs); only the branch slashes; and
- slug sanitization (lowercase; ``/`` ``.`` ``:`` and space → ``-``) lives HERE,
  so every shape that grows a slug gets the same normalization for free.
