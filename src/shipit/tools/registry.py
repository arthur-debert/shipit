"""The closed toolchain registry — the Tool verbs' dispatch axis (ADR-0007/0039).

A **Toolchain** names the build/test ecosystem of one path in a repo (rust,
go, python, npm, tree-sitter, lua) and carries the DEFAULT producing command per **tool slot**
(``test`` from WS01, ``build`` from WS02). A slot may be EMPTY — lua declares
no ``build`` (a Neovim plugin has no compile step), the buildless analogue of
the go/tree-sitter zero-file bump adapters — and :func:`shipit.tools.build.plan_build`
skips a leg whose build command is empty. The registry is CLOSED, the
lint ``Lang`` set's mirror: adding a toolchain is adding an entry here,
nothing downstream changes — and a toolchain is never a project-Kind switch
("a tauri Kind" is a composition of map entries, not a dispatch label).

The default test commands are release-core's battle-tested runners
(docs/legacy-prd/tol01-ci-tools.md, story 3): rust → cargo-nextest ("the standard
test runner used by bin/check-tests across the fleet"), go → ``go test
./...``, python → pytest. The npm default is NOT pinned by the PRD (story 3
lists only rust/go/python); ADR-0039's registry sketch names ``npm test``
— the package's own test script — and that is the default chosen here.

The default build commands are the legacy CI matrix jobs' single-target
builds (issue #555's legacy digest): rust → ``cargo build --release``
(``rust-ci``'s build-binaries job, minus the CI-routed ``--target`` matrix),
go → ``go build -trimpath -ldflags "-s -w" ./...`` (``go-cli``'s static
build over every package — the test slot's ``./...`` form; a bare ``go
build`` compiles only the root package and fails any repo whose packages
live under subdirs. The ``CGO_ENABLED=0`` env and the ADR-0041 ``-X``
version injection are shaped per invocation by :mod:`shipit.tools.build`,
since env and a supplied version are not argv defaults; an artifact-narrowed
build swaps ``./...`` for the artifact's one package there too), python →
``uv build`` (sdist + wheel in uv's
isolated build env), npm → the package's own build script (``npm run
build`` — same deference as the test slot; ``build-frontend`` is not a tool,
it IS this leg). Pixi is NEVER the build backend: these argv invoke the real
builder directly (PRD story 9) — provisioning stays in ``pixi.toml``.

These argv literals are the producing commands' ONE assembly point: per
ADR-0028, tool argv built outside its adapter is a defect, and the mechanized
sweep (``tests/test_tool_argv_sweep.py``) pins this module as the home for
the ``cargo`` / ``go`` / ``pytest`` / ``npm`` / ``uv`` heads. A per-path
override (``.shipit.toml``, :func:`shipit.config.load_toolchains`)
substitutes a consumer-declared argv for one leg — data, not a second
assembly point.
