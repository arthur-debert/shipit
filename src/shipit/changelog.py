"""changelog — the pure core of the language-agnostic release-notes Tool.

The changelog model (docs/dev/workflows.lex §4, PRD docs/prd/tol01-ci-tools.md
stories 18/26, TOL01-WS06 #554): release notes accumulate as FRAGMENTS under
``CHANGELOG/unreleased-*.md``, one per feature/fix PR — plain markdown
regardless of Toolchain, so nothing here carries per-language logic. The
committed ``CHANGELOG.md`` is a PROJECTION: rendered from ``CHANGELOG/*``
(fragments + per-version section files), never hand-edited. At cut time the
fragments are coalesced into the new version's section and ONE notes text is
emitted for both the git tag annotation and the GitHub release — release notes
exist exactly once, never re-derived in two places.

This module is the PURE half (PRD implementation decisions: pure cores,
effectful shells): recorded inputs — fragment name/body pairs, version-section
texts, a supplied version string — to asserted outputs. No filesystem, no git,
no clock (the date is an input). The effectful shell lives in
:mod:`shipit.verbs.changelog`, which reads the tree, calls down here, and
writes results; its git read rides the git adapter over the one Exec seam
(ADR-0028).

Three decisions of record bind the shapes here:

* **The version is supplied, never inferred** (ADR-0041): :func:`plan_coalesce`
  takes a bare semver string and validates it; nothing reads a version out of
  fragments or commit history. Bump-word resolution against the latest tag is
  the release pipeline's version resolver (TOL02), not this core.
* **Refuse an empty release** (story 26): zero fragments (and no already-cut
  section to resume from) is a hard :class:`ChangelogError` — an empty release
  is almost always a mistake.
* **Prerelease extracts, final rolls** (the legacy ``roll-changelog.sh``
  behavior, forked by copy per ADR-0001): a prerelease cut (semver-suffix
  detection, ADR-0041) emits the notes WITHOUT consuming the fragments —
  prereleases share their entries with the final they lead to; a final cut
  coalesces the fragments into the version's section and consumes them.

The fragment/render file conventions (``unreleased-*.md`` fragments,
``<semver>.md`` version sections, ``legacy.md`` for pre-model history, byte-order
fragment sorting) are forked by copy from release-core's ``changelog`` console
script — the ancestor the PRD's legacy mapping line ("changelog-check + roll →
``changelog``") names — never depended on.
