"""Edit-enforcement decision — the ADR-0012 coordinator guard (security core).

`decide(role, path, is_code, break_glass) -> Decision` is the security-critical
core: the `edit` **operation** is **blocking** when the actor's **role** is
`coordinator` AND the path is a code path AND no **break-glass** marker is
present; every other combination is allowed. The deny `reason` *is* the
coordinator's role-prompt slice, so the rule arrives as a wall at the moment of
action (the block teaches the next step, not just stops).

Three concerns, kept separate:
  - **The verdict** (`decide`) — pure over `(role, is_code, break_glass)`. `path`
    rides along for the (future) richer reason + the boundary's logging, but the
    security matrix turns only on the role, the code-ness, and break-glass.
  - **The code-path classifier** (`is_code_path`) — its own module,
    `harness.codepath`. The boundary calls it and passes the bool in, so the
    verdict stays a pure function of plain values.
  - **What counts as an `edit` operation** (`is_edit_tool`) — a boundary gate so
    the hook only ever evaluates file-mutating tools; `decide()` presumes it is
    already looking at an edit.

Break-glass is an INPUT here (a bool), not a separate module: reading the marker
is the boundary's (impure) job, so this verdict stays a pure function of its
arguments and is fully unit-testable on its own. The boundary
(`shipit hook pretooluse`) translates a `DENY` into the Claude Code
`hookSpecificOutput` JSON and an `ALLOW` into silence.
