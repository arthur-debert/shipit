"""Reading ``.shipit.toml`` — shipit's policy config.

``.shipit.toml`` owns policy (the secret map, reviewers, the path→toolchain map,
the declared ``[lanes]``, the pristine hashes); ``pixi.toml`` owns provisioning.
They describe different layers, so there is no split-brain
(docs/dev/architecture.lex §6). Step 1 needs only the ``[secrets]`` table.

The ``[secrets]`` table maps a GitHub secret NAME (the table key) to exactly one
source:

    [secrets]
    CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN = { doppler = "CRATES_IO_KEY" }
    GH_PAT               = { env = "SHIPIT_GH_PAT" }
    MANUAL_TOKEN         = { prompt = true }
    SCCACHE_GCS_KEY      = { doppler = "SCCACHE_GCS_KEY", optional = true }

``optional = true`` marks a source whose absence is a skip, not a fatal error.

    dispatches to its endpoint adapter, release-stage endpoints before derived
    ones); ``bundle_config`` by ``shipit release prepare`` (the
    artifact-declared bundle-config hook, ADR-0041/PRD story 25: the
    repo-root-relative JSON file — ``tauri.conf.json`` — whose top-level
    ``version`` is bumped in lockstep with the leg adapters, keeping "tauri"
    out of the bump dispatch registry); ``bundle`` by ``shipit release bundle``

    refused at parse otherwise, so signing can never silently degrade to an
    unsigned plan, never route to a signer leg that does not exist, and
    preflight/gh-setup cannot disagree over it. ``bundle`` follows the
    same rule for the same reason: it composes build outputs, so a bundle on a

# ``[reviewers]``, ``[lint]``, and ``[toolchains]`` are CONSUMER-OWNED POLICY
# (docs/dev/architecture.lex §6). They are NOT under the pristine-hash
# reconciliation: ``shipit install`` SEEDS them when absent and NEVER clobbers a
# consumer's edits. The App-secret mappings are MERGED into an existing
# ``[secrets]`` table (only the missing names are added, preserving every entry
# a consumer already wrote); the ``[reviewers]``/``[lint]``/``[toolchains]``
# scaffolds are written ONLY when their whole table is missing. A re-install on
# a fully-seeded config is a no-op. This keeps the seam inside the existing
# model — no new drift engine (issue #25 / INS01).

# The local-reviewer GitHub App credential mappings install seeds into a
# consumer's ``[secrets]``. Each GitHub secret NAME is sourced from the Doppler
# github/prd key of the SAME name; the credentials let a CI-side review post as the
# App bot with the same key the local path sources directly (CI parity). Seeding
# the mapping is safe even before a consumer's GitHub App is installed: gh-setup's
# sync derives an App pair's REQUIREMENT from the consumer's ``[reviewers]``
# declarations (#740, :func:`shipit.release.secretreq.reviewer_requirements`), so
# a seeded pair whose reviewer is never opted in is flagged as an orphan (not
# pushed, not demanded), and one whose reviewer IS declared must resolve or the
# sync fails loud.
#
# The key NAMES are never spelled here: they DERIVE from the Backend registry
# (:func:`shipit.agent.backend.funnel_backends` → ``doppler_pem_key`` /
