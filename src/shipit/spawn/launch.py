"""``spawn/launch`` — the headless-``claude`` child-process launcher (ADR-0019).

The launch contract WS01 implements *verbatim* from the WS00 spike. For the
``claude`` backend the Run is the ``claude`` CLI in headless print mode —
``claude -p "<task>" --agent <role> --permission-mode bypassPermissions
--output-format json`` — run as a subprocess with **``cwd`` = the Tree**, **stdin
from ``/dev/null``**, and **``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` scrubbed from the child env**.

Two of those are non-obvious, load-bearing spike findings (ADR-0019 §2/§3) that a
paper decision would have missed:

- **``--agent <role>``** is not cosmetic: a headless ``claude -p`` child is a fresh
  *top-level* session, so its ``PreToolUse`` payload carries no ``agent_type`` —
  which :func:`shipit.harness.role.resolve_role` maps to ``coordinator``, the role
  the guard forbids from editing. The native ``--agent`` flag populates
  ``agent_type`` so the guard allows the spawned Run's own edits. No change to
  ``resolve_role`` is needed; the launcher just passes the flag.
- **Scrubbing ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY``** is a hard requirement: a stale/invalid key in
  the env takes precedence over the claude.ai OAuth/keychain login and breaks the
  child's auth ("Invalid API key"). Removing it makes the child use the keychain
  login the parent is already logged in with.

The module is split pure-from-effectful so the whole contract is table-tested
without spawning a real ``claude``: :func:`build_command` / :func:`child_env` are
pure, and :func:`launch` takes an injectable ``runner`` (defaulting to the real
:func:`_subprocess_runner`).
