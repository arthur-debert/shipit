"""``spawn/backends/codex`` — the ``codex`` backend adapter (ADR-0020 §codex, WS02).

The second :class:`~shipit.spawn.backends.base.BackendAdapter`, wired from the WS00
spike's **probed** findings (`codex-cli` 0.139.0 — ADR-0020 §Decision-per-backend),
NOT from guessed flags. Three facts are load-bearing and non-obvious:

- **The bypass posture is mandatory for a WRITE Run.** ``codex exec`` defaults to a
  ``workspace-write`` sandbox under which the spike confirmed codex can edit files but
  is **denied ``.git/index.lock``** (``Operation not permitted``) and has **no network**
  — so it cannot ``git commit``, ``git push``, or run ``gh``. A Run whose deliverable is
  a *draft PR* therefore needs ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox``: the flag
  codex documents for *"environments that are externally sandboxed"*, which our chmod'd
  Tree (ADR-0018) **is**. With the flag the spike landed a real commit; without it the
  Run cannot produce its result. ``--skip-git-repo-check`` lets codex run in the Tree
  without re-litigating that it is a git checkout.
- **There is NO native ``--agent`` / ``--system-prompt``.** codex cannot be handed a
  role identity by flag (the way ``claude --agent <role>`` is), and it does **not** run
  under the shipit harness or its ``PreToolUse`` guard at all — it is a foreign runtime.
  So the role is conveyed the only native way the spike validated: **prepended to the
  task prompt** (:func:`_role_preamble`). Writing the role into an ``AGENTS.md`` /
  ``experimental_instructions_file`` in the Tree was rejected — it would pollute the PR.
- **codex auth is ChatGPT OAuth** (tokens in ``~/.codex/auth.json`` / ``$CODEX_HOME``),
  inherited by the child. The spike found a bogus ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` did *not* break
  codex 0.139 on the probe box (it preferred the stored tokens), but the safe
  generalization of ADR-0019 §3 still holds: :meth:`child_env` scrubs the **API-billing**
  keys ``OPENAI_API_KEY`` and ``CODEX_API_KEY`` so a stale key can never shadow the
  login or silently flip a Run onto API billing — the ChatGPT subscription stays the
  first-class auth. ``CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`` (:data:`ACCESS_TOKEN_VAR`) is different in
  kind — the *subscription-token* trusted-automation conduit codex consumes natively
  from the env — and deliberately PASSES THROUGH (CDX01-WS03 probe). **No** secret is
  ever written into the Tree.

**Reviewer (read-only) posture — WS04a, probed, NOT the ADR's first guess.** The ADR
recorded ``--ephemeral --sandbox read-only`` for a reviewer Run, but that decision was
taken when the reviewer *returned* its findings on stdout (the funnel captured them). In
the spawn-Tree path the reviewer **self-posts** via ``gh pr review`` — which needs the
**network**. WS04a probed codex 0.139 directly and found ``--sandbox read-only`` **blocks
the network** (``curl … → Could not resolve host``), so a read-only-sandbox reviewer
**cannot post its review**. Per ADR-0020 §Decision 3 the load-bearing read-only guarantee
is the **chmod'd Tree** (the FS layer), not the native sandbox, so the chosen reviewer
posture is the *least-privilege codex sandbox that still grants the network*:
``--ephemeral --sandbox workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true``
(probe-confirmed to reach the network). It deliberately does **NOT** carry the write Run's
``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox``: the chmod'd Tree makes the workspace
non-writable (the real guard), and ``workspace-write`` still confines any escape to
``[workdir, /tmp, $TMPDIR]`` as best-effort defense-in-depth. Selected by ``read_only=True``
on :meth:`build_command`. **WS04a scope ends at the reviewer launch posture** — the funnel
replacement + check-run/readiness wiring is WS04b.

        ``read_only`` selects the posture flags:

        - **write** (``read_only=False``, default): ``--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox``.
          Load-bearing — codex's default ``workspace-write`` sandbox blocks ``.git`` writes
          and the network, so a Run that must ``git commit`` / ``git push`` / ``gh pr create``
          needs the unsandboxed posture; the chmod'd Tree (ADR-0018) is the external sandbox
          that flag documents.
        - **reviewer** (``read_only=True``): ``--ephemeral --sandbox workspace-write
          -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true``. WS04a probed codex 0.139: a
          reviewer **self-posts** via ``gh pr review``, which needs the network, but
          ``--sandbox read-only`` (the ADR's first guess, taken when the funnel captured
          stdout) **blocks the network** — so the reviewer uses the least-privilege sandbox
          that still grants the network. It deliberately omits the write bypass flag: the
          chmod'd Tree is the load-bearing read-only guard (ADR-0020 §Decision 3), and
          ``workspace-write`` confines any escape to ``[workdir, /tmp, $TMPDIR]`` as
          best-effort defense-in-depth. ``--ephemeral`` skips session persistence.

        ``cwd`` is accepted for the seam (ADR-0020) but **ignored**: like ``claude``,
        codex roots in the Tree through the OS process ``cwd`` that
        :func:`shipit.spawn.launch.launch` sets, so no path belongs in its argv (unlike
        ``agy``, which ignores process ``cwd`` and is handed the Tree via ``--add-dir``).

        ``output_schema_path`` (TRE05-WS04b) — when given AND ``read_only`` — adds
        ``--output-schema <path>`` so codex enforces its structured output against the
        review JSON schema natively. It is the funnel **capture** reviewer's robustness
        win (ADR-0020 §migration-cost: *keep ``--output-schema`` on the codex reviewer*);
