"""`shipit pr ready` — the guarded draft→ready flip (and `--undo`).

The flip is the one signal that says "done iterating — a human can validate and
merge", so it is GUARDED: it refuses unless the engine says the PR is READY (all
three Ready pillars — Reviewed + CI green + authoritative-mergeable). The refusal
is a clean message + non-zero exit, never a silent no-op. `--undo` reverts
ready→draft and is ALWAYS allowed — sending a PR back to draft when a human asks
for changes is never held.

The guarded re-check lives in :func:`guarded_flip` so both this verb and
`pr next`'s ready act flip through the SAME guard: re-evaluate the live snapshot,
flip only on READY. Re-checking at flip time (not trusting a status computed
moments earlier) is what makes the flip safe against a state that moved.
