"""logs — locate and read shipit's durable per-repo JSONL log (LOG01-WS04).

The READER half of WS01's file sink: the writer (:mod:`shipit.logsetup`) drops a
durable, per-repo, rotating **JSONL** log (ADR-0029 — one flat JSON object per
record: ``ts``, ``level``, ``logger``, ``msg``, plus domain keys
present-when-bound); this verb finds it and shows it. It NEVER recomputes the
location — it consumes :func:`shipit.logsetup.log_file_path` (``resolve_log_dir``
+ the handler's ``LOG_FILENAME``), the single source of truth, so reader and
writer can never disagree about where the log lives. No platform ``if`` branch,
no bespoke log-dir env var (the path library owns the location, per the epic
``docs/prd/obs01-logging.md``).

The verb reads JSONL ONLY — a hard cutover, no dual-format sniffing (ADR-0029;
pre-cutover freeform files age out via rotation). Two output modes: the default
renders each record legibly for humans (``ts LEVEL logger: msg [key=value …]``);
``--raw`` passes the JSONL lines through unmodified — and prints nothing else —
so stdout pipes straight into jq. A line that is not a JSON object is skipped
with a stderr note, never a crash: the log is diagnosis data, and one corrupt
line (a torn write, a rotation seam) must not take down the reader.

The repo whose log we read defaults to the current checkout, resolved through the
:mod:`shipit.gh` boundary (the same source the sink uses); an explicit
``owner/repo`` argument overrides it. The ``gh`` boundary, the resolution base,
and the follow-loop ``sleep`` are injected in tests so nothing touches a real
``$HOME`` or shells out to ``gh``.
