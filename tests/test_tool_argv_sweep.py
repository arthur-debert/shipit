"""The mechanized argv-guard sweep: tool argv is built ONLY in its adapter.

ADR-0028's structural rule — "tool argv built outside its Tool adapter is a
statable defect" — enforced as an AST sweep over ``src/shipit``: any list/tuple
literal whose first element is a guarded tool's binary name, in any module
outside that tool's whitelisted assembly point(s), fails the build. The gh-only
sweep that pinned the PROC02 merge (formerly in ``test_gh_adapter.py``) is
generalized here into ONE table-driven test: adding the next tool is a
:data:`_ADAPTER_HOMES` entry, not a new test — plus a provisioning row in
``tests/test_tool_provisioning_guard.py`` (TOL02-WS17 #794: a new Exec tool
cannot land without a provisioning story; that guard fails until the row and
its inventory-doc line exist).

The sweep is deliberately literal-shaped (the same net as the original gh
sweep): it cannot see an argv assembled from a variable head, but every
adapter builds its argv as a literal starting with the binary name, so any
out-of-adapter literal — the copy-paste path a regression would actually take —
is caught mechanically.

#: The guard table: tool binary name → the module(s) allowed to assemble its
#: argv. One entry per guarded tool; extending the guard to the next tool is a
#: new row here, nothing else.
#:
#: - ``gh``   — the one gh adapter (:mod:`shipit.gh`).
#: - ``git``  — the one git adapter (:mod:`shipit.git`, its ``_argv``).
#: - ``pixi`` — the pixi adapter's two sides: execution
#:   (:mod:`shipit.pixienv.run`, ``run_argv``/``install``) and the read verbs'
#:   literals (:mod:`shipit.pixienv.read`).
#: - ``ps``   — the liveness probe's home (:mod:`shipit.session.liveness`,
#:   ``os_probe``): the OS process table has exactly one reader.
#: - ``curl`` — the lexd release fetch (:mod:`shipit.provision.lexd`): the one
#:   external download shipit performs (ADP00-WS03).
#: - ``cargo`` / ``go`` / ``pytest`` / ``npm`` / ``uv`` — the Tool verbs'
#:   default producing commands (TOL01-WS01/WS02): assembled ONLY in the
#:   closed toolchain registry (:mod:`shipit.tools.registry`); a per-path
#:   ``.shipit.toml`` override is consumer DATA, never a second assembly
#:   point. ``npm`` has a second sanctioned home: the Tree provisioner's
#:   frozen node install (``npm ci``, :mod:`shipit.tree.create` #543) —
#:   provisioning-side, a different concern from the producing dispatch.
#:   ``cargo`` and ``npm`` gain a third: the closed bump-adapter registry
#:   (:mod:`shipit.release.bump`, TOL02-WS01) — the release-side projection
#:   commands (``cargo set-version``/``cargo update``, ``npm version``),
#:   ADR-0041's one assembly point for the manifest bumps. ``cargo``,
#:   ``uv`` and ``npm`` gain the bundle-composition registry
#:   (:mod:`shipit.release.bundle`, TOL02-WS03) — the bundle-side composition
#:   commands (``cargo deb``, ``uv build --out-dir``, ``npm pack`` of the
#:   wasm-pack npm tree, TOL02-WS12 #788).
#: - ``wasm-pack`` — the wasm/npm bundle composition's builder (TOL02-WS12
#:   #788): assembled ONLY in the composition registry
#:   (:mod:`shipit.release.bundle`) — ``wasm-pack build`` the rust crate into
#:   the ``pkg/`` npm tree that ``npm pack`` then tarballs.
#: - ``tar`` / ``zip`` — the archiver invocations of the bundle compositions
#:   (TOL02-WS03): assembled ONLY in the composition registry
#:   (:mod:`shipit.release.bundle`) — the tarball/zip contract and the mac
#:   reseal payload. Both gain the signer unit (:mod:`shipit.release.sign`):
#:   ``tar`` for the reseal payload's unpack (TOL02-WS04) and the archive
#:   leg's reopen/re-emit, ``zip`` for the archive leg's per-binary notary
#:   container (TOL02-WS08 #779).
#: - ``codesign`` / ``security`` / ``xcrun`` / ``hdiutil`` — the mac signer
#:   unit's tools (TOL02-WS04): assembled ONLY in
#:   :mod:`shipit.release.sign` — keychain lifecycle, inner-first codesign,
#:   hdiutil reseal, notarytool submit/poll/staple.
#: - ``bin/check-e2e`` — the e2e harness registry's bats default
#:   (TOL01-WS03): the script head is assembled ONLY in the closed harness
#:   registry (:mod:`shipit.tools.e2e`); a declared ``e2e.harness`` argv is
#:   consumer DATA, never a second assembly point.
